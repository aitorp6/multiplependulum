# multiplependulum

Animated plot made with MATLAB. Ten uncoupled simple pendulums of different lengths swing at the same time producing visual wave patterns, random patterns, beats,.... 

Pendulums length have been adjusted to synchronize again when the shortest pendulum has done 40 oscillations. 


Here you can see the result:
